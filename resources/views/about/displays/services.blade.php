                           <h2>History of the Church</h2>
                           <p>True Church was founded in 1985 by a small group of believers who desired to establish a
                               gospel-centered church in our community. Starting with just 20 members, the church has
                               grown steadily over the past 35 years, now serving over 500 families.</p>

                                       <p>True Church holds firmly to the essential doctrines of the Christian faith as
                                           revealed in Scripture. We believe in the triune nature of God, the full deity
                                           and humanity of Jesus Christ, the authority and inspiration of the Bible,
                                           salvation by grace through faith, and the power of the Holy Spirit to
                                           transform lives.</p>
